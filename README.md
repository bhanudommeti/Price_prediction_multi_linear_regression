# Predictive Modeling for Car Prices using Linear Regression

This repository contains code for building a predictive model for car prices using linear regression. The dataset used is from the Toyota Corolla dataset (`ToyotaCorolla.csv`), and the analysis is done using Python programming language with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, and Scikit-learn.

## Introduction

* The goal of this project is to create a predictive model for car prices based on various features such as age, kilometers, horsepower, and more.
* Linear regression is used as the predictive modeling technique. The dataset is explored, cleaned, and visualized before building the model.
* Consideing only the below columns and prepare a prediction model for predicting Price.
[("Price","Age_08_04","KM","HP","cc","Doors","Gears","Quarterly_Tax","Weight")]

## Data Exploration

The dataset (`ToyotaCorolla.csv`) is loaded using Pandas, and initial exploration is performed. Descriptive statistics and visualizations help to understand the data.

## Data Preprocessing

Selected columns are extracted for modeling, and any duplicates in the dataset are removed. The data is then scaled using StandardScaler to ensure uniformity.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Correlation between features is visualized using a heatmap, and a 3D scatter plot is created to visualize the relationship between age, price, and kilometers.

## Feature Scaling

The data is standardized using StandardScaler to bring all features to a similar scale, which is essential for linear regression.

## Model Building

A linear regression model is built using the Statsmodels library. The model is trained on the selected features, and the summary statistics are analyzed.

## Model Evaluation

Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) is calculated to check for multicollinearity. The model is then tested with a new set of data to predict car prices.

## Conclusion

The linear regression model provides insights into the factors affecting car prices. The model can be further fine-tuned for better performance.
